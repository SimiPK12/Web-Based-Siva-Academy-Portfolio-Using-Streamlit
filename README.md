🌟 Excited to Share My Personal Portfolio! 🌟

I just launched my Web-based Personal Portfolio using Streamlit! 💻✨

This project allowed me to:

Showcase my Data Science projects 📊 and achievements

Highlight my education, skills, and work experience 🎓💡

Make it interactive and dynamic with features like expanders, sliders, and image galleries 🌐

Present my projects with clear descriptions and visuals, making it easier for recruiters and peers to explore my work 👀

💡 Streamlit made it super easy to turn Python scripts into a fully functional web app — no front-end frameworks required! 🐍⚡
